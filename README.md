# Quantum information and computing a.y. 2024/2025

Repository for the hands-on part of the course of Quantum information and computing a.y. 2024/2025 of the master degree in Physics of Data.
Each week a new folder will be pushed to the main branch, containing the hands on for that week.

## Usage

Either fork this repository for your account (see here for the instruction to [fork a GitLab repository on GitHub](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65023718/how-to-fork-a-gitlab-repository-to-github) ) or create your own branch in this repository, named `student/[your_surname]`.
Remember to either `git fetch` or `git merge` the main branch to your branch weekly to get the new updates.

## List of topics

1. A physicist survival guide: code editors, terminals, version control and compilation;
2. Handling tensors: reshaping, permuting and contracting order-$n$ tensors;
3. Python classes: abstract classes, inheritance and magic methods;
4. Information compression through Singular Value Decomposition;
5. Sparse matrices, graphs and ising model;
6. Imaginary time evolution for ground state search;
7. Optimized treatment of density matrices, entanglement;
8. Matrix product states: initialization, isometry center, measurement of local observables;
9. Quantum computing, quantum circuits, bell's pairs, QAOA for the graph coloring problem.
